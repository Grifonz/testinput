# Testinput

Create a small web application that accepts any number of inputs (decided by the user), show the input boxes where the user will be able to enter the values and then sort the values in ascending or descending order (decided by the user). Values can be all numeric, all strings or a mix of both.

Preferably all actions need to be performed on the same page.

There is no need to use any specific js libraries, TypeScript and React are preferred but you can use plain JS if you are not familiar with these technologies.

Style the application as you see fit.

Heavily comment your code and explain what sorting algorithm has been used.
